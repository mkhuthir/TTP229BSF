## GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The TTP229-BSF TonTouchTM IC is capacitive sensing design specifically for touch pad controls.
The device built in regulator for touch sensor. Stable sensing method can cover diversity conditions.
Human interfaces control panel links through non-conductive dielectric material. The main application
is focused at replacing of the mechanical switch or button. The ASSP can independently handle the 8
touch pads or up to 16 touch pads.
FEATURES
* Operating voltage：2.4V~5.5V
* Built-in regulator
* Stand-by current
At 3V, and sleep mode slow sampling rate 8Hz：
  * => Typical 2.5uA for 16 input keys
  * => Typical 2.0uA for 8 input keys
* Provides to set 8 direct keys or 16 direct keys by option
* Provides to set 8 separate outputs only for 8 direct input keys mode
* Has a 2-wires serial output interface, both can use for 8 and 16 direct input keys mode
* 8 separate outputs can select output driving types by option
(CMOS/OD/OC with active high/low)
* 2-wires serial interface can select active high or low by option
* Offer multi-key or single-key feature by option
* Provides two kinds of sampling rate that slow sampling rate 8Hz
and fast sampling rate 64Hz at sleep mode
* Have the maximum key-on time about 80sec by pin option
* Sensitivity can adjust by the capacitance(1~50pF) outside
* After power-on have about 0.5sec stable-time,
During the time do not touch the key pad, and all functions are disabled
* Auto calibration for environment changing
And the re-calibration period is about 4.0sec, when all keys are not activated for fixed time
